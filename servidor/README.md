# README for the Server

This directory contains the server-side code for the project. The server is responsible for handling requests, processing data, and communicating with the client application.

## Structure

- **src/app.js**: The main entry point for the server application. This file sets up the server, defines routes, and configures middleware.
- **src/servicios/exampleService.js**: An example service that contains functions for specific operations, such as database access or calculations.
